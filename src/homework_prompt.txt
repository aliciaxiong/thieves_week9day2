Like Button Exercise
- Create a Like Component
- Must use a "react-icon" (heart, thumbs up, etc.)
- When clicked, log to the console "liked" BUT if it's already liked it should log "unliked"
- Along with the logs, if "liked" the icon should be "filled", otherwise the icon should be "unfilled".

        }
     })

        // your code here
